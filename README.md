# workout-tracker

## My motivation for this project was to build a workout tracker using front end code given to us by the bootcamp and then adding back end code (specifially by creating models, routes, and the server.js file, along with a noSQL database.. 

#### I built this project, in part, to showcase my understanding of how to connect front end code to the back end using a noSQL database and then deploying it via Heroku using MongoAtlas.  

#### This application solves the problem often of how to develop a full stack web application that uses a noSQL database.

#### In this project, I learned a lot -- more specifically -- more about Mongoose, MongoDB, and MongoAtlas, and additional information about JavaScript including using "aggregate, $addFields, and $sum.

#### Please see the screenshots below for a preview of the UI:
